    HOW YOU WILL MAKE THE CPP PROJECT

This readme is for you,
the people that are reading this. 

First of all, you can do this yourself.
		
		VERY IMPORTANT DATES

	PROJECT DUE DATE: 
	-> Fri, 9 Jan 2026

	FIRST COMMIT IN myproject.zip WAS MADE ON:
	-> Wed 9 Dec 2025 

To do it you need to master some basics of the computer.
If you are reading this, you already know how to:

	-> List Directory ........................... l
	-> Change Directory ......................... cd
	-> Get Path Of Working Directory............. pwd
	-> Print Text Files ......................... cat

A little bit of bash and C++ can take you
a very long way in programming. I hope by now 
you learned how to get to any 
directory(folder) you want in your computer.

        How to change adress
        $cd <adress>

This is the adress of your location in the computer
