		VERY IMPORTANT DATES

	PROJECT DUE DATE: Friday, 9 Jan 2026
	FIRST COMMIT IN myproject.zip: 
To do it you need to master some basics of the computer.

A little bit of bash and C++ 
can take you a very long way in programming. I hope by now 
you learned how to get to any 
directory(folder) you want in your computer.

        How to change adress
        $cd <adress>

This is the adress of your location in the computer
